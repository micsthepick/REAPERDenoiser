desc:Ratio Denoiser (github.com/nbickford/REAPERDenoiser)
// That's the description of the plugin. This is how it'll show up in the effect
// search dialog, as well as the text at the start of its user interface. We use
// it as the first line of the script per the JSFX documentation's
// recommendation (https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php#js_file)

// Define our user interface.
// Our FFT size will always be the same, so we only need controls for
// the noise collection mode and the noise scale (k).

// This defines a combo box that allows the user to select "Denoise Input" or
// "Record Noise Sample". The default value is 0 (Denoise Input). The maximum
// value is 1 (Record Noise Sample), and it increases in steps of 1.
slider1:0<0,1,1{Denoise Input, Record Noise Sample}>Noise Collection Mode

// This defines a slider that can be varied between 0.0 and 10.0 in steps of
// 0.001, with default value 1.0. (If slider2 is equal to 0.0, this plugin
// shouldn't really do anything to the input audio.)
slider2:1<0.0,10.0,0.001>Noise Scale

// Here we can label our input and output pins. This also tells REAPER how many
// channels we can handle. In this case, the plugin is stereo (a monophonic
// plugin would be simpler, but I almost always use this to denoise stereo
// audio), so we define two input and output pins.
